## How to Compile on ACI

Switch to the root folder of the homework. Use the commands below:

    module load gcc/5.3.1
    make

Or you could use `make program` instead of `make`.

You should see "Make completed." if everything goes on well.

## Expected Output

## Write-up Compilation

The write-up is generated with [overleaf](https://v2.overleaf.com). A copy is already included in the folder `writeup`.

To generate a new copy, please upload the .tex and .bib file to the website, along with the three figures in the `output` folder.

Create an `output` and a `writeup` folder under one project, place all the figures under `output`, and place the other files under `writeup`.

Set main file of project as `writeup/main.tex`, then click the compile button to get the output.

## Acknowledgements

Please see the LaTeX write-up and its PDF output for details.
